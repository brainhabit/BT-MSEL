This repository includes custom scripts for data analysis for the paper: 
The latent structure of emerging cognitive abilities: an infant twin study. 
Bussu G., Taylor M., Tammimies K., Ronald A., Falck-Ytter T.

Analyses focus on the investigation of the etiological structure underlying emerging cognitive and motor abilities early in infancy within the Babytwins Study Sweden (BATSS).

Scripts cover preparation of twin data for modelling (bt-prepdata.R), multivariate twin modelling (bt-multivariate.R),
and association analysis of early developmental level and polygenic scores for cognition, educational attainment, and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions through GEE (gee_PGS.R).
